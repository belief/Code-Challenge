Thank you for your interest in Belief.
======================================

We have a new client that has requested an interactive site for their audience. They are looking for ways to get people interested in their story and get excited about the company. Your subimission will be the homepage of this site using the design and assets included. Please provide instructions installing any tools or dependencies.

What we look for
----------------
We will be looking at the quality and professionalism of you work. In particular we look for clean, well organized and maintainable code. Although we are only asking for a single page, you can be as creative as you want on your development process. Using SCSS and other build tools is encouraged. 

The Specifics
-------------
We want UX to be as important as UI, and below are ideas to think about designing the webpage. 
- Is a Navigation bar needed as you scroll?
- Did you consider hover states?
- What animations did you use to reveal hidden sections?

When you are finished
---------------------
Please push your solution to the master branch in the provided github repository. There is no need to fork this repository to your own github account.


Guidelines
----------
You are welcome to use static html, and any vendor software you wish to use. We would prefer you use some javascript and scss to build your core assets. Furthermore, we have supplied all fonts to be used in the current design. Among the fonts, you will find ss-social-regular, this font is designed for social media icon rendering - please try it out and use it.

One main aspect for the site is a video that is to highlight the company. We want you to integrate a vimeo video to replace the hero image after the play button has been pushed. You do not have to use a lightbox, but please bleed the video just as the hero image. You can grab the video embed from the video below. You do not have to worry about Vimeo API integration to play the video automatically, but if interested: https://developer.vimeo.com/player/js-api.
